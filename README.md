# micro-reddit

This is the micro-reddit project from [The Odin
Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails)
web curriculum.

The goal was to create models for a micro-reddit
app, where users could create posts and comment on
posts. 

I applied the necessary associations and
validations, but didn't implement a front-end.
The code was just tested out in the rails console.
